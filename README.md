# Programmerings-Projekt-30010: Space Invaders & Asteroids-Inspired Game

This repository contains the code and documentation for a programming project developed as part of the "30010 Programmeringsprojekt" at DTU. The goal was to design and implement a game inspired by *Space Invaders (1978)* and *Asteroids (1979)* using low-level C programming on the STM32F302x8 microcontroller.

## Key Features:
- **Game Mechanics**: Includes moving enemies, power-ups (TNT and hearts), and asteroid-based gravity zones.
- **Three-Layer Architecture**: Application Layer, API Layer, and Hardware Abstraction Layer ensure modularity and scalability.
- **Peripheral Integration**: Utilizes LCDs, joysticks, buzzers, LEDs, and terminal emulators like PuTTY for gameplay and UI.
- **Interactive Elements**: Custom player controls, animated graphics, and a functional menu with high scores and help sections.
- **Boss Key**: A "panic button" that displays a mock Excel screen.
- **Iterative Development**: Features were tested and debugged extensively to ensure functionality and adherence to project requirements.

## Achievements:
The project fulfills all predefined goals and includes several enhancements like wormholes and animated shooting effects. Despite time constraints, it successfully demonstrates an efficient workflow and practical application of microcontroller programming.

## How to Use:
1. Configure the STM32 microcontroller and PuTTY as described in the documentation.
2. Build and upload the code using STM32CubeIDE.
3. Explore the menu to navigate through levels, high scores, and help screens.
4. Enjoy the gameplay with joystick or keyboard controls.
